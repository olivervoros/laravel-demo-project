Hello All!

The purpose of this Laravel Demo Project is to demonstrate my skills of using various intermediate and advanced concepts of the framework. I am using Laravel version 6.

(My website: https://www.olivervoros.com for more info about me...)

And now let's see the examples:

1, Facades

Facade is an OOP design pattern, it is an object that serves as a front-facing interface masking more complex underlying or structural code. Facades are an important concept of Laravel. 
I have developed a WeatherForecast Facade, which demonstrated how Facades work in Laravel.
You can access the example by issuing "git checkout facades".

2, Eloquent Relationships
